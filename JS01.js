// use strict safe us from making mistakes

//console.log is used to print something on console

// what is string

// something that is enclosed in single qoutes 'hamad' or double quotes "hamad" so the enclosed words are string

console.log("hello world");

//variable is used to store some information that can be use and change in future/later

// var is the keyword for variable

// we have to declare a variable so in the below line the declare variable is 'first name'
// var > is the keyword , firstname is the > declare ,and hamad is the > string

var firstname = "hamad";

// mow to implemnt the var keyword we will type "Console.log"firstname";"
console.log(firstname);

// now change value

firstname = "ahmed ali";

console.log(firstname);

var lastname = "ullah";

console.log(lastname);

// Rules for naming variable
// never start with number
// example    >>var 8value=8>>invalid wrong    ===   var value8=8;>>valid right

var value8 = 8;
console.log(value8 - 98);

// so in the above example we see that we can add ,sub , multiply and divide with numbers
